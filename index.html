  <h1> Public Spending Visualization Tool</h1>
  <br>

  <p>    
    The application can be used to filter data by agency, program, funding source, and time period,
     allowing users to analyze specific data of interest. This can provide valuable insights into 
     how taxpayer money is being spent and identify areas that may require more funding or budget 
     cuts. It can help government officials and policymakers make data-driven decisions on budget 
     allocation and prioritize spending based on public needs and priorities. By utilizing this 
     application, stakeholders can access and analyze data more efficiently, leading to better-informed
      decision-making and more effective use of public funds.

  <h2>Departmental Expenditures</h2>
  <p>
    When examining the distribution of government funding in Prince George's County, it becomes apparent that there are several 
    departments that receive a significant amount of financial resources. Among them, the Health and Transportation departments
     stand out as some of the biggest spenders. These departments appear to receive substantial funding due to the crucial nature
      of their services, which are necessary for the well-being and safety of the community.
    <br><br>
    On the other hand, some departments seem to receive less funding from the county budget. Among them, the Environment and Family
     Services departments have a lower budget allocation compared to other departments. It is important to note, however, that this
      does not necessarily mean that these departments are less important or provide less valuable services. Rather, it may indicate
       a need for greater attention and support from the county to address the specific needs of these departments and ensure that
        they can operate effectively.</p>
