What is your actual project trying to display and solve:

1.The problem: The PG county contains many departments, ranging from animal shelters, the environmental department, health department and etc. Some smaller departments are often overlooked for funding, this causes them to not perform at their best potential. 

2.My Solution: Increasing transparency by making these spending records more accessible allows the general public (and the representative of underpaid departments) to ask more questions and see if funds can be better utilizied. There are a lot of issues in our county which can be fixed with some funding, better allocating these funds can benefit us and our community.

3.What I am trying to Display: Pie charts containing all the departments, bar graph containing total amount of spendings, and finally, a data table contaings all records.
